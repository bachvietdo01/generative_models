# A Gentle Introduction to Flow Matching Models

Welcome to this repository, which provides a gentle introduction to **Flow Matching Models** â€” a class of generative models that offer an powerful way to learn mappings between probability distributions.

## Installation Guide


```
https://github.com/bachvietdo01/generative_models.git
cd flow_matching
uv sync
```


## Running the code

The Jupyter notebook main.ipynb walks through all the steps for training a Flow Matching model and generating samples from an 11-component Gaussian Mixture Model.
