# A Gentle Introduction to Diffusion Models

Welcome to this repository, which provides a gentle introduction to **Diffuson Models** â€” a class of generative models that offer an powerful way to learn mappings between probability distributions.

## Installation Guide


```
https://github.com/bachvietdo01/generative_models.git
cd diffusion_model
uv sync
```


## Running the code

The Jupyter notebook **main.ipynb** walks through all the steps for training a Diffusion model and generating samples from an 11-component Gaussian Mixture Model.
